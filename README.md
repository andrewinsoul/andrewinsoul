### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Andrew from Lagos, Nigeria. I am a full-stack developer who has a strong interest in blockchain technology with over 4 years of professional experience. I'm an ardent open minded person who see challenges as an opportunity to grow.
When I am not coding, you can find me writing and making music.

I have worked with different teams like Andela, TeamGrace Healthcare, Quika, PodRoom and others.
Got an interesting and challenging project you need a developer to jump on, I am a click away.
